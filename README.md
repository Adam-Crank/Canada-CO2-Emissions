# Canada-CO2-Emissions

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to gain additional practice using Tableau, and uses CO2 Emissions data by make and model from Canada, sourced from open data. 
My approach was to look at the data, which did not feature any fully electric vehicles, and make recommendations to somebody who was in the market for a vehicle with an
internal combustion engine, but wanted to remain relatively environmentally conscious. The dashboard contains three pages, the first of which contains a summary of
findings from a brief exploratory data analysis and my recommendations, while the latter two point out some interesting features about the data that I noticed, as 
pointed out below:

1. The first, main summary page of the dashboard features average CO2 emissions by number of cylinders, type of fuel, and vehicle class. Additionally, I examined which
  vehicles had the highest and lowest emissions on average using the list of all models, and their makes denoted by color. The bottom right text area highlights what my
  recommendations are based on this data.
2. The second page takes a deeper look at the bottom 10 vehicles by average emissions featured on the first page. This time, however, it's juxtaposed with a chart
  highlighting the top 10 models by gas mileage/fuel efficiency, as that is another factor that an environmentally conscious consumer may be interested in. Interestingly,
  the two lists are very nearly identical, and even more fascinating, both lists only feature 4 distinct car makes- This data is what leads me to recommend one of 4 car
  makes on the first page of the dashboard's listed recommendations.
 3. Lastly, though this didn't have any bearing on my recommendations, I plotted average CO2 emissions by gas mileage, and the resultant curve was fascinating. In addition
  to being a surprisingly smooth curve, the sections of the data that seem to be broken off or clustered together actually correlate very closely wih vehicle class.
  Although I am not entirely familiar with how vehicle class is defined (e.g., how certain organizations may classify a vehicle as a van versus a utility truck), this
  metric might potentially serve as another way to classify vehicles.
